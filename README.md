# Lionel Kubwimana

Software engineer, CTO, and product builder.  
I build practical software that solves real business problems, with a strong focus on finance, operations, and reliability.

I’m currently open to discussing how I can help companies ship faster, scale systems, or simplify complex workflows.

---

## What I do

- Build and ship production systems (Rails, React, Flutter)
- Design multi-tenant SaaS platforms
- Improve performance, reliability, and architecture of existing systems
- Build tools around finance, reporting, and operational workflows

I care about:
- solving real problems
- keeping systems simple and maintainable
- shipping continuously instead of endlessly planning

---

## What I’m passionate about right now

Finance is a topic I’m deeply interested in:
- personal finance
- financial systems
- tools that help people and companies make better decisions

But I also enjoy working on any project where software directly helps a business operate better:
- internal tools
- dashboards
- automation
- backend systems
- APIs

If there is a real problem to solve, I’m interested.
